What do managers do?

<!-- Note -->
And I hope we also agree that in no particular order, there are five
things should apply approximately equally to any manager. At least
they’re my expectation of any manager, including of myself:


###  Managers

care about people,

have a grip on what's happening in their group,

act as an interface to other groups,

are accountable,

deliver.

<!-- Note -->

* I want to care about the people working with me,
* I want to understand where they are in their contribution to
  delivering our product or service,
* I want to be an interface to other teams, via other managers at my
  level,
* I want to be accountable and responsible for what we do as a group,
* I want to ensure that we deliver what we build on time, on budget,
  and as a good contribution to our overall business.


With how many people does this work?

<!-- Note -->
A little while back, on a whim and prompted by something I had seen at
work, I ran a Twitter poll asking: if those are the things managers
ought to be doing, what is the maximum number of people we should be
doing it with?


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/poll.png" data-background-size="contain" -->

<!-- Note -->
And the results were not surprising; they reflected what’s more or
less the conventional wisdom: the general expectation is that a
manager ought to be capable of doing this with a team size of up to 10
people.


If you think you can do all 5 for more than 5 people,

**you’re kidding yourself.**

<!-- Note --> 
And this is wrong. If you — and this is me talking to those of you who
*are* managers — want to fulfill those 5 requirements, then there’s no
sensible way to do that for more than 5 people.

Because:


Every person for whose work you are responsible will take up about
20% of your own working time.

**And that’s fine.**

<!-- Note -->
If you want to do well in these these 5 things, then every person for
whose work you hold responsibility will take up 20% of your time. So
that means:


TODO: 60% pie chart

<!-- Note -->
If you run a team of 3 people (excluding yourself), then 60% of your
time will go toward fulfilling these 5 responsibilities for them.


TODO: 100% pie chart

<!-- Note -->
By the time you get to 5, you’re a full-time manager. If you don’t
want to compromise your dedication and your obligation to your people,
that’s the limit.

That’s impossible! I hear you cry. How dare you!


I can do this for more people!

<!-- Note -->
Surely you can do this for more people. A significant number of
managers can do this for more people. But they won’t be able to do it
without making life harder for the people they work with.

— every knowledge worker, everywhere, always

<!-- Note -->
Because there’s nothing that depresses people’s motivation and
productivity so much as standing between them and their goals.

So:


With more than 5 people,

**you’ll need daily standups to know where they are.**

Or daily status reports. People love those just as much.

With more than 5 people,

**you’ll have to use your daily standups to gauge how they feel.**

People love that even more.

<!-- Note -->
TODO


With more than 5 people,

**people from other teams will have to do end-runs around you.**

<!-- Note -->
TODO


With more than 5 people,

**you’ve got no way to stay on top of things, technically.**

And it’s really hard to be responsible if you’re clueless.

With more than 5 people,

**it’s really hard to pass on credit and absorb blame.**
