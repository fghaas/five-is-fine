##  Managers

care about people,

have a grip on what's happening in their group,

act as an interface to other groups,

are accountable,

deliver.

<!-- Note -->
And I hope we also agree that in no particular order, these five
things should apply approximately equally to any manager. At least
they’re my expectation of any manager, including of myself:

* I want to care about the people working with me,
* I want to understand where they are in their contribution to
  delivering our product or service,
* I want to be an interface to other teams, via other managers at my
  level,
* I want to be accountable and responsible for what we do as a group,
* I want to ensure that we deliver what we build on time, on budget,
  and as a good contribution to our overall business.

A little while back, on a whim and prompted by something I had seen at
work, I ran a Twitter poll asking: if those are the things managers
ought to be doing, what is the maximum number of people we should be
doing it with?

And the results were not surprising; they reflected what’s more or
less the conventional wisdom: the general expectation is that a
manager ought to be capable of doing this with a team size of up to 10
people.


If you think you can do all 5 for more than 5 people,

**you’re kidding yourself.**
