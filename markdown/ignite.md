What do managers do?

<!-- Note -->
And I hope we also agree that in no particular order, there are five
things that should apply roughly equally to any manager. 

At least they’re my expectation of any manager, including of myself:


###  Managers

care about people,

have a grip on what's happening in their group,

act as an interface to other groups,

are accountable,

deliver.

<!-- Note -->

* I want to care about the people working with me,
* I want to understand where they are in their contribution to
  delivering our product or service,
* I want to be an interface to other teams, via other managers at my
  level,
* I want to be accountable and responsible for what we do as a group,
* and I want to ensure that we deliver — on time, on budget, and as a
  good contribution to our overall business.


With how many people does this work?

<!-- Note -->
Not too long ago I ran a Twitter poll asking: if those are the
things managers ought to be doing — and there was no disagreement that
they are — then what is the maximum number of people we should be
doing it with?


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/poll.png" data-background-size="contain" -->

<!-- Note -->
And the results were not surprising. They reflected what’s more or
less the conventional wisdom in our industry: the general expectation
is that a manager ought to be able to do this with a team size of up
to 10 people.


If you think you can do all 5 for more than 5 people,

**you’re kidding yourself.**

<!-- Note --> 
And I’ll submit that this is wrong. If you — and this is me talking to
those of you who *are* managers — want to fulfill those 5
requirements, then there’s no sensible way to do that for more than 5
people.

Because:


Every person for whose work you are responsible  
**will take up about 20% of your own working time.**

<!-- Note --> 
If we want to do well in these these 5 things, if we agree that
they’re important and we want to take them seriously, then every
person for whose work we hold responsibility will take up 20% of our
time. So that means:


![60% pie chart](images/60-40.svg)

<!-- Note -->
If I run a team of 3 people (excluding myself), then 60% of my
time will go toward fulfilling these 5 responsibilities for them, and
only 40% of my work time will be available for my own active
contribution to our product.


![100% pie chart](images/100-0.svg)

<!-- Note -->
By the time I get to 5, I’m a full-time manager. I make no direct
contribution to our product anymore. If I don’t want to compromise my
dedication and my obligation to my people *and our business* under
those five responsibilities, that’s the limit.

Now some of you will of course say, “that’s nonsense!”


“I can manage more people!”

<!-- Note -->
... “I can manage more people!”

Surely we can manage more people. A significant number of managers
*do* manage more people.

But we’re not able to do that *without compromising those five
responsibilities,* and thus making life harder for the people we work
with.


> “A good manager is someone who gives me objectives and guardrails,
> and then gets out of my way so I can accomplish things.”

— every knowledge worker, everywhere, always

<!-- Note -->
Because our job is to give our teams objectives and guardrails, and
then let them succeed. And there’s nothing that depresses people’s
motivation and productivity as much as getting in the way between them
and their objectives, *which we define for them.*


With more than 5 people,

**you’ll need daily standups to know where they are.**

(or daily status reports 🙄)

<!-- Note -->
With more than 5 people, it becomes impossible for me, as a manager,
to keep track of what my team is doing by just watching them do their
thing. That’s how we end up with the necessity of something like daily
standups — because that’s the only way to keep track of how they’re
doing.


### Daily standups

as seen by

![Comparison of views on daily standups from managers and engineers](images/managers-engineers.svg)

<!-- Note -->
And let me tell you a secret: Daily standups are as much liked by
managers as they are disliked by engineers. If we’re thinking we’re
doing our people a favor by having daily standups, think again —
because that’s a favor we’re doing *ourselves,* likely to their
disadvantage.


With more than 5 people,

you’ll have to use your daily standups to gauge how they **feel, too.**

<!-- Note --> 
And we’ll need to use that daily standup to gauge how they’re
*feeling,* too. Are they humming along, or barely coping?  Are they
crushing it, or is it crushing them?

Do you know? With 6 people, 7, 10? are you sure?


With more than 5 people,

**you won’t be able to understand in detail on what your team does.**

<!-- Note -->
With more than 5 people it also becomes impossible to *understand in
detail* everything our group does — not just their actions, but also
their decisions, the options they considered and discarded,
and went with a different one.


**And that means you’re no longer able to be an interface to other groups.**

<!-- Note -->
But that understanding is a crucial prerequisite for us to act as an
interface to other groups.

If we fail at this, our people will need to coordinate directly with
other people at their level in other teams, *and that’s not their
job.*

As managers it’s *our* job to be that interface, and with too large a
team size we actively keep ourselves from doing it.


With more than 5 people,

**you’ve got no way to stay on top of things, technically.**

<!-- Note --> 
Furthermore: In a technical leadership role, we can’t *not* understand
what our team does. Staying on top of things is a prerequisite so we
can make informed decisions. 

Handwaving is not in our job description.


**And you can’t be responsible if you’re clueless.**

<!-- Note -->
So what if we don’t understand something? Well, then we have a capable
and highly expert team to explain it to us, in detail, and then we can
decide.

But it’s next to impossible to pull that off if the team is large, 
with a wide array of specialties and great depth in expertise.


With more than 5 people,

**it’s really hard to pass on credit and absorb blame.**

<!-- Note -->
From all of this it follows that with a team of more than 5
people, it becomes really difficult to reasonably take full
accountability and responsibility for everything that the team does,
*particularly* when things go south. 

*But that’s the very definition of a person in charge:* we absorb
blame by ourselves, and we pass on credit to the team.


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/burnout.png" data-background-size="contain" -->

<!-- Note -->
And you want to be in a position where you confidently *can* do that —
because if you’re not, your’re putting your health, your sanity, your
family, and your career on the line. And no-one should be doing that.
