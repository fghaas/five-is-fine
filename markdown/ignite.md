What do managers do?

<!-- Note -->
And I hope we also agree that in no particular order, there are five
things should apply approximately equally to any manager. At least
they’re my expectation of any manager, including of myself:


###  Managers

care about people,

have a grip on what's happening in their group,

act as an interface to other groups,

are accountable,

deliver.

<!-- Note -->

* I want to care about the people working with me,
* I want to understand where they are in their contribution to
  delivering our product or service,
* I want to be an interface to other teams, via other managers at my
  level,
* I want to be accountable and responsible for what we do as a group,
* I want to ensure that we deliver what we build on time, on budget,
  and as a good contribution to our overall business.


With how many people does this work?

<!-- Note -->
A little while back, on a whim and prompted by something I had seen at
work, I ran a Twitter poll asking: if those are the things managers
ought to be doing, what is the maximum number of people we should be
doing it with?


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/poll.png" data-background-size="contain" -->

<!-- Note -->
And the results were not surprising; they reflected what’s more or
less the conventional wisdom: the general expectation is that a
manager ought to be capable of doing this with a team size of up to 10
people.


If you think you can do all 5 for more than 5 people,

**you’re kidding yourself.**

<!-- Note -->
And this is wrong. If you want to fulfill those 5 requirements,
there’s no sensible way to do that for more than 5 people.


Every person for whose work you hold responsibility will take up about
20% of your own working time.

**And that’s fine.**
