What do managers do?

<!-- Note -->
And I hope we also agree that in no particular order, there are five
things that should apply approximately equally to any manager. At
least they’re my expectation of any manager, including of myself:


###  Managers

care about people,

have a grip on what's happening in their group,

act as an interface to other groups,

are accountable,

deliver.

<!-- Note -->

* I want to care about the people working with me,
* I want to understand where they are in their contribution to
  delivering our product or service,
* I want to be an interface to other teams, via other managers at my
  level,
* I want to be accountable and responsible for what we do as a group,
* I want to ensure that we deliver what we build on time, on budget,
  and as a good contribution to our overall business.


With how many people does this work?

<!-- Note -->
Now a little while back, I ran a Twitter poll asking: if those are the
things managers ought to be doing — and there was no disagreement that
they are — then what is the maximum number of people we should be
doing it with?


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/poll.png" data-background-size="contain" -->

<!-- Note -->
And the results were not surprising; they reflected what’s more or
less the conventional wisdom in our industry: the general expectation
is that a manager ought to be capable of doing this with a team size
of up to 10 people.


If you think you can do all 5 for more than 5 people,

**you’re kidding yourself.**

<!-- Note --> 
And I’ll submit that this is wrong. If you — and this is me talking to
those of you who *are* managers — want to fulfill those 5
requirements, then there’s no sensible way to do that for more than 5
people.

Because:


Every person for whose work you are responsible  
**will take up about 20% of your own working time.**

<!-- Note --> 
If we want to do well in these these 5 things, if we agree that
they’re important and we want to take them seriously, then every
person for whose work we hold responsibility will take up 20% of our
time. So that means:


TODO: 60% pie chart

<!-- Note -->
If I run a team of 3 people (excluding myself), then 60% of my
time will go toward fulfilling these 5 responsibilities for them, and
only 40% of my work time will be available for my own active
contribution to our product.


TODO: 100% pie chart

<!-- Note -->
By the time I get to 5, I’m a full-time manager and I make no direct
contribution to our product anymore. If I don’t
want to compromise my dedication and my obligation to my people
*and our business* under those five responsibilities, that’s the
limit.

Now of course some of you will say, that’s nonsense!


I can do this for more people!

<!-- Note -->
Surely you can do this for more people. A significant number of
managers *do* this for more people. But we’re not able to do it
without compromising those five responsibilities, and thus making
life harder for the people we work with.


> “A good manager is someone who gives me objectives and guardrails,
> and then gets out of my way so I can accomplish things.”

— every knowledge worker, everywhere, always

<!-- Note -->
Because our job is to give our teams objectives and guardrails, and
then let them succeed. And there’s nothing that depresses people’s
motivation and productivity as much as getting in the way between them
and their objectives, *which we define for them.*

So:


With more than 5 people,

**you’ll need daily standups to know where they are.**

(or daily status reports 🙄)

<!-- Note -->
With more than 5 people, it becomes impossible for me, as a manager,
to keep track of what my team is doing by just watching them do
their thing. That’s how we end up with daily standups — because that’s the
only way to keep track of how they’re doing.


TODO: Results of poll on standups

<!-- Note -->
And let me tell you a secret: Daily standups are as much liked by
managers as they are disliked by engineers. If we’re thinking we’re
doing our people a favor by having daily standups, think again —
because that’s a favor we’re doing *ourself,* to their disadvantage.


With more than 5 people,

you’ll have to use your daily standups to gauge how they **feel, too.**

<!-- Note -->
And we’ll need to use that daily standup to gauge how they’re
*feeling,* too. Are they humming along or barely coping? Are they
churning away at peak productivity, or are they scraping their
personal barrel? Are they crushing it, or is it crushing them? And
that’s even worse.


With more than 5 people,

**you won’t be able to understand in detail on what your team does.**

<!-- Note -->
With more than 5 people it also becomes impossible to stay informed to
the point of *understanding,* in detail, everything our group does —
not just their actions, but also the technical motivation, the
problem-solving options they considered and discarded, and went with a
different one. 


With more than 5 people,

you won’t be able to stay understand in detail on what your team does.

**And that means you’re no longer able to be an interface to other groups.**

<!-- Note -->
But that understanding is a crucial prerequisite for us to act as an
interface to other groups.

The minute we can no longer do that, our people will need to
coordinate directly with other people at their level in other teams,
*and that’s not their job.*

As managers it’s *our* job to be that interface, and with too large
a team size you we actively keeping ourselves from doing it.


With more than 5 people,

**you’ve got no way to stay on top of things, technically.**

<!-- Note --> 
Furthermore: In a technical leadership role, we can’t *not*
understand what our team does. Staying on top of things is a
prerequisite so we can make informed decisions. Handwaving is not in
our job description.


With more than 5 people,

**you’ve got no way to stay on top of things, technically.**

And it’s really hard to be responsible if you’re clueless.

<!-- Note -->
What if we don’t understand something? Well, then we have a capable
and hightly expert team to our team explain it to us, in detail, then
decide.

But it’s next to impossible to pull that off if the team is over 10
people, all with different areas of expertise.


With more than 5 people,

**it’s really hard to pass on credit and absorb blame.**

<!-- Note -->
From all of the above it follows that with a team of more than 5
people, it becomes really difficult to reasonably take full
accountability and responsibility for everything that the team does,
*particularly* when things go south. *But that’s the very definition
of a person in charge:* we absorb blame for yourself, and we pass on
credit to the team. 


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/burnout.png" data-background-size="contain" -->

<!-- Note -->
And we want to be in a position where you confidently *can* do that —
because if we’re not, we’re putting our health, our sanity, our family,
and our career on the line. And no-one should be doing that.
