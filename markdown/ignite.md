What do managers do?

<!-- Note -->
And I hope we also agree that in no particular order, there are five
things that should apply approximately equally to any manager. At
least they‚Äôre my expectation of any manager, including of myself:


###  Managers

care about people,

have a grip on what's happening in their group,

act as an interface to other groups,

are accountable,

deliver.

<!-- Note -->

* I want to care about the people working with me,
* I want to understand where they are in their contribution to
  delivering our product or service,
* I want to be an interface to other teams, via other managers at my
  level,
* I want to be accountable and responsible for what we do as a group,
* I want to ensure that we deliver what we build on time, on budget,
  and as a good contribution to our overall business.


With how many people does this work?

<!-- Note -->
Now a little while back, I ran a Twitter poll asking: if those are the
things managers ought to be doing, what is the maximum number of
people we should be doing it with?


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/poll.png" data-background-size="contain" -->

<!-- Note -->
And the results were not surprising; they reflected what‚Äôs more or
less the conventional wisdom: the general expectation is that a
manager ought to be capable of doing this with a team size of up to 10
people.


If you think you can do all 5 for more than 5 people,

**you‚Äôre kidding yourself.**

<!-- Note --> 
And this is wrong. If you ‚Äî and this is me talking to those of you who
*are* managers ‚Äî want to fulfill those 5 requirements, then there‚Äôs no
sensible way to do that for more than 5 people.

Because:


Every person for whose work you are responsible  
**will take up about 20% of your own working time.**

<!-- Note --> 
If you want to do well in these these 5 things, if you agree that
they‚Äôre important and you want to take them seriously, then every
person for whose work you hold responsibility will take up 20% of your
time. So that means:


TODO: 60% pie chart

<!-- Note -->
If you run a team of 3 people (excluding yourself), then 60% of your
time will go toward fulfilling these 5 responsibilities for them.


TODO: 100% pie chart

<!-- Note -->
By the time you get to 5, you‚Äôre a full-time manager. If you don‚Äôt
want to compromise your dedication and your obligation to your people
*and your business* under those five responsibilities, that‚Äôs the
limit.

Now of course some of you will say, that‚Äôs nonsense!


I can do this for more people!

<!-- Note -->
Surely you can do this for more people. A significant number of
managers *do* this for more people. But they won‚Äôt be able to do it
without compromising those five responsibilities, and thus making
they‚Äôre making life harder for the people they work with.


> ‚ÄúA good manager is someone who gives me objectives and guardrails,
> and then gets out of my way so I can accomplish things.‚Äù

‚Äî every knowledge worker, everywhere, always

<!-- Note -->
Because your job is to give your team objectives and guardrails, and
then let them succeed. And there‚Äôs nothing that depresses people‚Äôs
motivation and productivity as much as getting in the way between them
and their objectives.

So:


With more than 5 people,

**you‚Äôll need daily standups to know where they are.**

(or daily status reports üôÑ)

<!-- Note -->
With more than 5 people, it becomes impossible for you, as a manager,
to keep track of what your team is doing by just watching them do
their thing. So, you‚Äôll end up doing daily standups because that‚Äôs the
only way you‚Äôll be able to keep track of how they‚Äôre doing.


TODO: Results of poll on standups

<!-- Note -->
And let me tell you a secret: Daily standups are as much liked by
managers as they are disliked by engineers. If you‚Äôre thinking you‚Äôre
doing your people a favor by having daily standups think again ‚Äî
because that‚Äôs a favor you‚Äôre doing *yourself,* to their disadvantage.


With more than 5 people,

you‚Äôll have to use your daily standups to gauge how they **feel, too.**

<!-- Note -->
But what‚Äôs worse is that you‚Äôll need to use that daily standup to
gauge how they‚Äôre *feeling,* too. And that‚Äôs even worse. 


With more than 5 people,

**you won‚Äôt be able to understand in detail on what your team does.**

<!-- Note -->
With more than 5 people it also becomes impossible to stay informed to
the point of *understanding,* in detail, everything your group does ‚Äî
not just their actions, but also the technical motivation, the
problem-solving options they considered and discarded, and went with a
different one. 


With more than 5 people,

you won‚Äôt be able to stay understand in detail on what your team does.

**And that means you‚Äôre no longer able to be an interface to other groups.**

<!-- Note -->
But that‚Äôs a crucial prerequisite for you to act as an interface to
other groups.

The minute you can no longer do that, your people will need to
coordinate directly with other people at their level in other teams,
*and that‚Äôs not their job.*

As a manager it‚Äôs *your* job to be that interface, and with too large
a team size you are actively keeping yourself from doing it.


With more than 5 people,

**you‚Äôve got no way to stay on top of things, technically.**

<!-- Note --> 
Furthermore: In a technical leadership role, you can‚Äôt *not*
understand what your team does. Staying on top of things is a
prerequisite so you can make informed decisions. Handwaving is not in
your job description.


With more than 5 people,

**you‚Äôve got no way to stay on top of things, technically.**

And it‚Äôs really hard to be responsible if you‚Äôre clueless.

<!-- Note --> 
Don‚Äôt understand something? Have your team explain
it to you, in detail, then decide. 

And it‚Äôs next to impossible if your team is over 10 people with
different areas of expertise.


With more than 5 people,

**it‚Äôs really hard to pass on credit and absorb blame.**

<!-- Note -->
From all of the above it follows that with a team of more than 5
people, it becomes really difficult to reasonably take full
accountability and responsibility for everything that the team does,
*particularly* when things go south. *But that‚Äôs the very definition
of a person in charge:* you absorb blame for yourself, and you pass on
credit to the team. 


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/burnout.png" data-background-size="contain" -->

<!-- Note -->
And you want to be in a position where you confidently *can* do that ‚Äî
if you‚Äôre not, you‚Äôre putting your health, your sanity, your family,
and your career on the line. And no-one should be doing that.
